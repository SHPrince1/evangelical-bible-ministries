                  In July 1909, a son was born into the Akindayomi family of
                  Ondo State of Nigeria. Even though this child grew up
                  surrounded by idol worshippers, he knew there existed a
                  greater power and yearned to know, “The God who created the
                  earth and everyone on it”. This pursuit for God led him to the
                  Church Missionary Society where he was baptized in 1927. Still
                  spiritually unfulfilled, he joined the Cherubim and Seraphim
                  church in 1931.

                  Whilst there, he began to hear a voice within him saying, “You
                  will be my servant.” Since this was not his intention, he
                  decided to ignore the voice. This went on for seven years
                  during which all the business ventures that he tried resulted
                  into failure. In debt and without peace of mind, he found
                  himself totally dependent on the grace of God. Here marked the
                  beginning of a definite relationship with God.Totally broken,
                  he yielded saying, “Lord, I will go wherever you want me to
                  go.” He asked for signs to confirm that this was indeed God’s
                  call. The confirmation came through the Bible passages of
                  Jeremiah 1:4-10, Isaiah 41:10-13 and Romans 8:29-31. The Lord
                  assured him that He would provide for all his needs, as he
                  would not receive any salary from that point on. This proved
                  to be a comforting reminder during the trials in the months
                  ahead. He became married in 1941. He continued to worship with
                  the Cherubim and Seraphim. In 1947, he started to become
                  concerned that the church was departing from the true Word of
                  God in some of its practices. By 1952, he felt totally
                  persuaded to leave the church. He started at Willoughby
                  Street, Ebute-Metta, Lagos a housefellowship called, the Glory
                  of God Fellowship. Initially there were nine members but
                  before long the fellowship rapidly grew as the news of the
                  miracles that occurred in their midst spread.
